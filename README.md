# My_macropad
This is my macropad. I designt it for multiple usecases. With 9 buttons it can be used for a lot of things. And it also have 16 rgb leds, so it looks also great.

## CAD Model
It has 2 pieces, that connect together with screws and heatset inserts. the bottom piece should be from white filament, so it diffuses the filament.

## PCB
It is two sided. It has a bit tangled connections between the RP2040 and the components. I tried to make it the best i can.

## Firmware
I made it in KMK (It was the easiest for me). The buttons are programmed to do a couple macros (Mute, undo, redo etc.).
